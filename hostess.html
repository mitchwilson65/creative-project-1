        recreational instructor for you.</h4>
      <p class='third-info info'>One block off main street, Noadi lives in a quaint household with
        great music, food, and conversation.  She found her voice while protesting for the Vietnam
        War: acryllic painting.  She pronounces Vietnam to rhyme with "am", as in "I am".  She
        believes that art is an expression of self, of one's innermost beliefs.  Thus, she believes
        art is her most powerful medium for expressing her belief that the universe is a war machine.
        She believes that war is the ultimate game: the purest way to figure out those of whom the universe
        condones the existence.  Words, clearly, are not the appropriate canvas for this belief, though.
        To really understand, one must look deep into the acryllic paint to see the root of the matter.</p>

    <p class='info'>You may be wondering at this point, where does the name Noadie come from, anyway?
      Answer?  Ireland.  Noadie is, as Google tells us, the reduced Anglicized form of
      Gaelic O Droma 'descendent of Droma', which may be from the word druim, signifying
      back, or ridge, perhaps.  Some think that the name was originally developed by bullies
      who called out those with defomed backs.  Luckily, Noadie's back is far from deformed.
      In fact, it has been called one of the best backs in Park City.</p>
