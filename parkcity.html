      <h2 class="subtitle">Park City</h2>
      <p class='pc-info info'> Park City, one of the main hubs of the 2002 Winter Olympic Games, has a population
        of around 13,000 or so.  It is considered part of the Wasatch Back.  There are many
        more tourists roaming around Park City than permanent residents.</p>

      <h2 class='subtitle'>Attractions</h2>

      <p class='info'>Park City is bursting with fun things to do.  In the Winter, one can head up the gondolas
      and ski lifts to partake of the best snow in the world.  To the non-skiers out there, of whom Noadie is
      one, there is dog-sledding, fly fishing, ice skating, snow biking, snowmobiling, snowshoeing, and tubing
      to be had!  Noadie actually isn't a fan of any of these.  She prefers to paint and write in her book of
      thoughts on war.  In the Summer, mountain biking, hiking, horseback riding, hot air ballooning, rafting,
      ziplining, and riding the alpine coaster/slide are sure to send your family out of the counseling office,
      and into a place of fun and love.</p>

      <h2 class='subtitle'>Painting</h2>

      <p class='info'>Sometimes, when all the adventures have been had, it's best to unwind the bow and
        settle in for some painting.  Sometimes, it's time to go from recreating to creating.  Make a
        <a href='reservation.html' class='reservation-link'>reservation</a> now with Noadie to come do just that.  Any afternoon or
        evening, acryllic painting is just the activity you need to keep the mind going, but get the body
        ready for the next activity!</p>
